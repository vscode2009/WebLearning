    <h1>Cricket for Viraj</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each 
        end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then 
        running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to 
        either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and
         by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can 
         cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two 
         umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical 
         information.</p>
<h2>What It Like</h2>
         <hr>
         <p>Forms of cricket range from Twenty20 (also known as T20), with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of 6 fair 
            opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three to four hours, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally 
            cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear
             protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam 
             enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.</p>

             <h2>Origins</h2>
             <hr>
             <p>Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement; others include baseball 
                (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball games category[2]), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, 
                badminton and table tennis.[3] In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is 
                thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend.[4] The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three
                 "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to and from between two targets (the goals); the "golf group",
                  in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket)
                   and driven away from it".[5]</p>
